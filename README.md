For the last change, I'm adding two scenes. The first one is the main scenario, which will show two buttons, one for easy and the other for hard. The easy button will show the bird eating the gold coins, when the bird touches the gold coins, the gold coins will disappear and one point will be added to the score. When the bird touches the ground or the bird's score reaches 10 points, the game will end. The hard button will appear the bird passes through the trees, every time the bird passes through the trees once, the score will be added one point, but when the bird hits the trees, the game will end and the bird's score will be recorded every time, and the 5 best scores will be selected to make a leaderboard. Background music and sound effects have been added to all scenes to make the game more vivid.
